                Once a skilled physician, Emily Dyer dedicated her life to

                admiration. However, whispers of her true identity began to
                spread—Emily was not a licensed doctor but a self-taught healer
                with a mysterious past. Fleeing from those who sought to expose
                her, she found herself at Oletus Manor, where her medical skills
                became both a blessing and a curse in the endless game of
                survival.

                Once an ambitious lawyer, Freddy Riley built his career on sharp
                arguments and well-crafted lies. He had a talent for twisting
                the truth, ensuring his clients walked free—no matter their
                crimes. But when he defended the wrong person, a powerful enemy
                turned the tables, leaving him disgraced and hunted. Seeking
                refuge, he arrived at Oletus Manor, hoping to escape his past.
                Yet in a place where rules mean nothing, even the best defense
                may not be enough to save him.

                authorities or take a mysterious invitation to Oletus Manor.
                Believing he could outsmart whatever lay ahead, he chose the
                latter. Now, in a place where danger lurks at every turn, his
                skills may be the only thing keeping him one step ahead of fate.

                Once a blind girl shunned by society, Helena Adams possessed an
                uncanny ability to perceive the world beyond sight. Raised in an
                orphanage, she relied on her heightened senses to navigate life,

                audiences with her graceful performances. Behind her charming

                Once a gifted toymaker, Anne Lester’s creations brought joy to
                children, but they also carried hidden messages for those in
                need. Her secret work aiding fugitives drew the attention of
                dangerous individuals, forcing her to flee after a delivery went
                wrong. Seeking refuge, she arrived at Oletus Manor, where her
                toys are no longer just for play—they are tools for survival in
                a game she never intended to join.
