            Lurking in the darkness, they stalk their prey with ruthless

      <h3>SURVIVORS</h3>
      <p>
         United by fear but driven by hope, these individuals fight for
         survival in a game where every second counts. Will they escape the
         Manor’s grasp, or become lost in its shadows?

       <h1>The Secrets of Oletus Manor: Identity V’s Haunting Backstory</h1>
      <p>
        Behind the fog-covered grounds of Oletus Manor lies a story filled with
        tragedy, mystery, and deception. <br />The game of survival is not just
        a mere competition—it is a never-ending cycle of lost souls, <br />each
        bound by their past and the sinister forces at play. Every character,
        whether survivor or hunter, carries a burden—a forgotten memory, an
        unfinished story, <br />or a tragic fate. As players uncover journal
        entries and hidden clues, the truth behind the manor, <br />
        its enigmatic owner, and the terrifying experiments conducted within its
        walls begins to unfold. But beware—some secrets are meant to stay
        buried. <br />
        Are you ready to uncover the truth, or will you become just another lost
        piece in this twisted game?
